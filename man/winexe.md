running iBPP on Windows
=======================

downloads Windows executables:
- for [v2.1.3](https://github.com/pavonvazquez/iBPP_exeForWindows/blob/master/ibpp.exe)
- for [v2.1.2](http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~ane/programs/ibpp.exe)

These executables and instructions below were provided by
Carlos J. Pavón Vázquez (Departamento de Biología Evolutiva, UNAM, Mexico)
and Emmanuel A. Pavón Vázquez.
Many thanks!

- place the .exe file and the input files in the same folder.
- open a `cmd` window and then specify the working folder with the `cd` command.
- type `ibpp.exe` followed by a space and the control file name,
  then press enter.
- if an antivirus is running it can mess with the program,
  so it might be best to temporary turn it off while the program is running.
- the `cmd` window can be widened using instructions
  [here](http://superuser.com/questions/401621/how-can-i-widen-the-windows-7-command-prompt-window)
  for example.
